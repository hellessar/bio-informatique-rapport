\section{Structurally informed function prediction}
   \subsection{differents methods}
   
   There are two types of binding site prediction methods :
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item The sequence based method which identify conserved residues that may be structurally or functionally important
     \item The structure based method which is energetic, geometric method and use miscellaneous methods.
   \end{enumerate}

   \subsection{Function prediction in CASP}
      \subsubsection{What is it ?}
         
         That consist on make the prediction of ligand binding residues within a protein of unknown structure.
         
      \subsubsection{ligand binding site residue prediction methods}
         
         \begin{enumarate}
           \item Predict the location of the protein binding site
           \item Predict the ligand and location of the ligand within the binding site
           \item Predict the residues that bind to the ligand within the binding site
         \end{enumerate}

      \subsubsection{what's the utility ?}
         
         These tools are needed on many fields like annotation of genome, \textit{de novo} drug design, or mutagenesis studies.\\
         It's also used in the elucidation of protein function and to predict ligand binding specificity.
