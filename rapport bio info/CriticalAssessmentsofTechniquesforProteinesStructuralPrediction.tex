\section{Critical Assessments  of Techniques  for Proteines Structural Prediction}
\subsection{What and Why?}

The aim is to improve the advance on the protein structure identification. 
The CASP (Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction) aim to etablish the actual state of the protein structure prediction methods, to identify progress which were made, and highlight the best directions to take.

it's therefore an official and international competition, which test proteins structure prediction methods. The latter is divided on any categories

\subsection{CASP Categories}

   The CASP rewards many type of methods, which are listing.
   This represents the different fields concerned by the protein structure prediction. On all of this categories, there are many team of researchers who present them method to predict a protein structure.

\begin{enumerate}
   \item Tertiary structure prediction
   \item Template-based modelling
   \item Template-free modelling
   \item Oligomer prediction
   \item Disorder prediction
   \item Contact prediction
   \item Model quality assessment
   \item Function prediction
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{CASP's History}
   The championship was created in 1994, and it occurs all 2 years.\\
   Also, in 2014, we assisted to the eleventh edition.\\

   This permit, now, to automate the models creation, and keep the same quality than the models of humans expert modellers.\\
   Morever, it given the community a benchmark to test the usefulness of their algorithm.\\
