\section{Critical Assessments  of Techniques  for Proteines Structural Prediction}
\subsection{What is it?}

It stands for a world championship of predictive structure. This "competition" has started in 1994, and it is define, by themselves their objective to be to help advance the methods of identifying protein structure sequence. They provide the architecture to make these research such as servers, samples and consulting.
\newline
With time the CASP became bigger and bigger. It can provides very advanced proteins modelisation tehcnics. A very big consortium has been created since then, with american research group such as Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), New York Structural Genomics Research Center (NYSGRC).
