\section{Limitations et perspectives}
\subsection{Limitation}
The first limitation is also 3D dependency. Without the protein's modelization it is impossible to go further. This dependancy is related to the database, if the query returns a null value, no prediction will be used.
\newline
Each sequency can only have one prediction, in that case a multi-expression sequency will be quickly eliminated and there will be a lack of accuracy in the prediction.
\subsection{Perspectives}
The first upgrade would be a higher ligand residue detection. This ugrade will allow to directly increase the protein's prediction. Indirectly, this accuracy rising will be related to the software constraint, such as the 3D recongnition. 
\newline Another upgrade could be a better 3D modelization that will allow a better flexibility in form recognition. This will allow to have better result between the model and the targeted protein.
\newline This implies a consequent architecture. Indeed, this accuracy increasement will be paired with data volume. The higher the  precision, the higher the data will be.
